# Food Desert Analysis

## What is one way that government officials could use `plot_food_access_by_county`
## or `plot_low_access_tracts` to shape public policy on how to improve food access?
If there are limited resources to provide for regions with low food access,
officials can prioritize who gets the food first by looking at the plots and
analyzing which areas commonly have low food access based on the different
criteria used for each plot. That way, the areas that meet the criteria often
can get the food resources they need first.


## What is a limitation or concern with using the plots in this way?
The data itself contains information about affordable, nearby, and nutritious access
to food, meaning if an area is marked a food desert, it could be for many reasons;
the food might be overpriced but still available, affordable but not nutritious,
affordable and nutritious but far away, etc. When distributing resources above stated
in the above question, there could be problems if these different reasons aren't
considered. For example, a place with food (but not nutritious or affordable) could
get food before the areas that just do not have available food at all.
